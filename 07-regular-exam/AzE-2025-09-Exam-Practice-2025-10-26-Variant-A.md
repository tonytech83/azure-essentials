# Exam: AzE 2025.09 -- 26.10.2025 (Variant A) {#exam-aze-2025.09-26.10.2025-variant-a}

## Rules

- Be sure to follow exactly the **IP addresses**, **resource names, file
  names, etc.** as requested in the tasks

- Tasks execution order should not be derived from the order in which
  they are listed below

- Ð¢here are tasks that depend on the successful completion of one or
  more other tasks

- All resources are expected to be in **one region** (of your choice).
  If you deviate from this, state the reason(s)

- If not stated explicitly, use the smallest and cheapest possible
  resource option that will do the job

- Feel free to set up public IP addresses or other options to virtual
  machines or other resources for debugging purposes

- **The aim is]{.underline}** not to build a production-ready solution
  but a **working one]{.underline}**

**_NOTE: This document has 3 pages]{.underline}. Make sure you read
all of them]{.underline}_**

## Goal

You are expected to create the following set of resources:

  space **10.0.0.0/16**

  **10.0.1.0/24**

- (T203, 1 pts) Create a network security group **SG-VM** and attach it
  to the **NET-SUB-VM** subnet and create two **inbound** rules:

  - (T203.1, 1 pts) one, named **Rule-SSH**, to allow communication on
    port **22/tcp**

  - (T203.2, 1 pts) and a second one, named **Rule-HTTP**, to allow
