# Homework M5: Azure and DevOps

The main goal is to build further on what was demonstrated during the
practice

## Tasks

1.  AKS task

    - Create an AKS cluster with one node

    - Prepare a simple web app (single static HTML page) with one
      picture (or whatever you decide) and a text with your SoftUni ID

    - Create a Dockerfile to containerize the app

    - Create an ACR and publish the app image there

    - Create a manifest (or two) and deploy the app on the cluster

> _You may use the files and the steps from the practice to help
> yourself._

2.  DevOps task

    - Create a Web App for a runtime of your choice (one of .NET, Java,
      Python, or NodeJS)

    - Create a simple application in the chosen framework based on the
      PHP application used during the practice

    - Create a DevOps project for the application that includes Repo and
      Pipeline and deploys the application to the Web App

Please note that you can do either one of the tasks or both. Whichever
you choose, your submission will be accepted, and you will be eligible
to receive the corresponding amount of homework points

## Proof

Prepare a document that shows what you accomplished and how you did it.
It can include (not limited to):

1.  The commands you used to achieve the above tasks

2.  Any configuration files produced while solving the tasks

3.  A few pictures showing intermediary steps or results
